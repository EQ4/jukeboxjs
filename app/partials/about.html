<h2>Getting Started with Jukebox.js and the Web Audio API</h2>
<h3>What is Jukebox.js?</h3>
<p>
	Jukebox.js is a Javascript library for playing sounds, generally music, using the Web Audio API. Jukebox.js borrows a lot from the design of actual, real life synthesizers.
</p>
<p>
	Using Jukebox.js you can:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Generate electronic versions of your of your favorite tunes. This is similar to <code>Midi,</code> and the file size can be extremely small.
		</li>
		<li>
			Generate the sound track for your game in real time. Using music and sounds generated with Jukebox.js can reduce the size of your game by 10mbs or more.
		</li>
		<li>
			Compose different Jukebox elements in an infinite number of layers and in an infinite number of ways
		</li>
		<li>
			Turn handheld devices like phones and tablets into musical instruments
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	The Jukebox library is relatively simple, having only two main classes - Modulators and Synthesizers, which are both explained in detail in the documentation.
</p>
<p>
	Synthesizers and Modulators both use Javascript objects called <code>schema</code> to change the way they behave. Jukebox.js comes packaged with lots of different schema, so there's no need to make your own until you want even greater custom control.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Synthesizers</strong> are used for making musical instruments, like the keyboard and drumpad in this demo.

</p>
<p>
	<strong>Modulators</strong> are used to generate custom tones of a specific frequency. They can be composed into synthesizers, or used on their own to generate cool sound effects.
