    <h2>Getting Started with Jukebox.js and the Web Audio API</h2>
    <h3>What is Jukebox.js?</h3>
    <p>
        Jukebox.js is a Javascript library for playing sounds, generally music, using the Web Audio API. Jukebox.js borrows a lot from the design of actual, real life synthesizers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using Jukebox.js you can:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Generate electronic versions of your of your favorite tunes. This is similar to <code>Midi,</code> and the file size can be extremely small.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generate the sound track for your game in real time. Using music and sounds generated with Jukebox.js can reduce the size of your game by 10mbs or more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Compose different Jukebox elements in an infinite number of layers and in an infinite number of ways
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn handheld devices like phones and tablets into musical instruments
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

            <p>
                The Jukebox library is relatively simple, having only two main classes - Modulators and Synthesizers, which are both explained in detail in the documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Synthesizers and Modulators both use Javascript objects called <code>schema</code> to change the way they behave. Jukebox.js comes packaged with lots of different schema, so there's no need to make your own until you want even greater custom control.

                    <strong>Synthesizers</strong> are used for making musical instruments, like the pad in this demo.

            <h4>
				Modulators
			</h4>
            <strong>Modulators</strong> are used to generate custom tones of a specific frequency. They can be composed into synthesizers, or used on their own to generate cool sound effects.

            		Using the Library
            	</h4>
            	<p>
            		In order to use the library, all you need to do is include a link to the <code>jukebox.js</code> file. It is also recommended you include the <code>html5webaudio shim</code>, which improves compatibility with additional browsers. Sadly, IE does not support web audio at all.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		In addition to the Jukebox library, including the <code>schema</code> pack is recommended, especially for beginners. If space is an issue, power users can skip shemas in favor object literals. See the section on schemas.
